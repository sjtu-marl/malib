"""
This file gives an implementation of a typical training framework in multi-agent learning: Centralized training and
decentralized execution training workflow. Users can use this agent interface to implement algorithms like MADDPG.
Besides, our implementation can work in a more general case: users can register multiple policies in heterogeneous.

Example:
    >>> algorithm_candidates = {
    ...     "PPO": {},
    ...     "DDPG": {},
    ...     "DQN": {}
    ... }
    >>> learner = CTDEAgent("agent_0", ..., algorithm_candidates)
